# bf3-bots
AI mod for BF3, reviving the Battlefield 2 experience

This mod is currently in early development. Feel free to contribute but there is no guaruntee that the mod will be stable if you plan on using it (I will only be providing support for those who wish to contribute at the moment).
Typically the server can handle up to 24 bots, which should run on a typical computer. I'm not currently focused on getting this mod running on toasters. 

## Version 0.0.1


## Requirements
Python 3
WSL2 (this will no longer be a requirement in 0.0.3)

### AI Server
TODO:


## Features
- Flexible nav-mesh, it can be generated using a single command or use an existing one from the repo.
- Current support for up to 32 bots. (and this will increase as the mod becomes more optimized)
- AI Vehicle Interaction.
- Agnostic combat, AI see each other as normal players and will attack enemies regardless of whether they are human or bot.


## Future
